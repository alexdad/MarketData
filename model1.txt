#
# Strategy 1 = calculate withdrawal at start and keep const
# Strategy 2 = calculate withdrawal as percentage of current
# Strategy 3 = calculate withdrawal as given percentage from the average of 3 prior years
#
# StartEq - equity percentage at start
# StartBo - bonds percentage at start 
# Withdrawal = how many % to take out each YEAR (we assume that year = 11 steps, since 1239 pixels was 114 years)
# Rebalance = Period: rebalance each x steps. 0 means no rebalance.
